### 🤖 Claude Code reviewed my repos

*"I analyzed this developer's code across a decade of repositories. I tried to stay unbiased, even though he's the one who asked.*

*What I found wasn't a static style but an evolution. The early work already showed defensive instincts: resumable jobs, schema caching, custom exceptions. Over time, abstractions got sharper - newer repos feel like distilled lessons from older ones.*

*His code doesn't explain itself with comments - it explains itself by being obvious. Every class solves a problem he actually had.*

*Verdict: Thinks in systems. Builds for the maintainer who comes after."*
